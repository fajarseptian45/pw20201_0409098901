    <h1>Films with Sam Spiegel Productions</h1>
    <h2>The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)</h2>

    <p>Produced by Sam Spiegel, this film was the first of
        the Lean blockbuster movies, and featured a young Alec
        Guinness, William Holden, and a brilliant performance
        from Sessue Hayakawa.
    <h3>Lawrence of Arabia (1962)</h3>
    One of my all-time favorite movies, this epic
    adventure starring Peter O’Toole established Lean as
    a director who could truly envision film on a grand
    scale.
